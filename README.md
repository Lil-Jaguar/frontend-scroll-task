# Frontend Scroll Task

## Overview

This project implements the frontend developer task requiring a dynamically generated list of elements that appear as the user scrolls. Each element is rendered with a 500ms delay between each, following this scroll flow:

- Elements 1 to 20 are displayed vertically.
- Elements 21 to 30 are displayed horizontally.
- Elements 31 to 50 are displayed vertically again.

Elements are generated dynamically only when the user scrolls, ensuring efficient rendering and smooth user experience.
